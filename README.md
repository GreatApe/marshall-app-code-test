# Marshall Application Role Coding Test

## What we want from you
Please create a public repository because, in the end, you need to share that repository with us, to allow us to evaluate your work. Give us a code that makes you proud!

## Task
You are tasked with making an app that displays a list of cryptocurrencies for a group of users in the USA and Sweden. Each user should be able to get the default prices in USD and then be able to switch the prices to SEK. Use as many data points as you deem necessary to make the user experience valuable to the end user. Make assumptions that you think are necessary in delivering this app. Prices should be displayed in USD. Users should be able to switch currency to SEK in the app and get updated prices.
